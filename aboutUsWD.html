    <h2>About Us</h2>

      <h3>Susan Hargus</h3>
      <br>
          <p><img id="susanimg" src="assets/Susan-Hargus.png" alt="Susan Hargus">Susan Hargus is an aspiring software developer and a classical realist painter who is fascinated with the creative connection between tech and art. She and her husband moved from Los Angeles to a small college town in rural Iowa seeing an opportunity to balance the upbringing of their two young children. She has a BFA that includes studies at both the Minneapolis College of Art and Design and the University of Iowa. While in Minneapolis she honed her painting skills at an Atelier where she learned the centuries old classical realism method of painting. She has long held an interest in coding which includes an appreciation of the deep thinking problem solving skills that are also found in art where every stroke you make is a conscientious decision. She appreciates codingâ€™s inherently creative qualities and its ever evolving nature, and loves that it provides the opportunity for continual discovery. She came to DeltaV seeking a new career that offers financial security in uncertain times. And she hopes that a career in the tech industry will give her an opportunity to affect positive progression in her community.</p>

I've had various jobs, mostly in customer and food service.  I love computers and wanted to learn how to code for a long time before coming to DeltaV.  I'm excited to continue to develop my skills at DeltaV code school.  I hope to take what I've learned here and apply it to a long successful career in software development.</p>
