         <h5>Following are some typical Odyssey Theatre for the Young of Art Questions and Answers to the basics and the rules of play:</h5>
         <br>
         <p><b>What exactly are the workshops?</b> The workshops provide an opportunity for students aged 5-25 to become involved in live “Theatre for and by the Young of Art,” to learn about all aspects of creative dramatics and theatre and to work collaboratively to create a shared work that culminates in a final production for audiences. While most students choose to focus on ACTING in our workshops, we do offer a focus on TECHNICAL classesFollowing are some typical Odyssey Theatre for the Young of Art Questions and Answers to the basics and the rules of play: to students 5th grade and up who would like to learn more about backstage—from building sets to costumes, from finding and making props to painting, and hanging lights—as well as stage management and front of house responsibilities.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p><b>How much does it cost?</b> The cost has changed very little over the past twenty years here in Mount Vernon because I wish to make it possible for each and every student to participate—without any child or parent/guardian worrying about the cost. Toward that end both partial and full tuition scholarships are available upon request—and I’ve been known to barter for a really good pie or two—and no questions asked. That said, there are considerable costs to pull this madcap fun off so regular registration prices are listed on each year’s registration forms. We also welcome donations if you feel so inclined to support our Odyssey scholarships, or our complimentary ticket program, or our graduating seniors gift program to show support of the local arts and art students! 
         </p>
         <br>
         <p><b>What if I can’t afford to pay?</b> As noted above, no one is ever turned away from playing with us. Pay what you can or not at all. The important thing is being involved in play!
         </p>
         <br> 
         <p><b>When are the workshops?</b> The workshops are held twice a year: The Summer Drama Workshop meets for three weeks 3 hours per day during  part of June/July; the Holiday Show meets after school three days per week and Saturday afternoons part of November/December.
         </p>
         <br> 
         <p><b>Where will we meet?</b> We will be meeting in the Mount Vernon Middle School in the Auditorium, Band Room and/or in the Gymnasium. Students should enter through front doors unless otherwise notified and should be picked up promptly at the end of rehearsal each day
         </p>
         <br> 
         <p><b>How long will we meet every day?</b> For the Holiday Shows we meet Tu, We, and Th from
            3:30-5:00 pm. and Saturday from noon till four pm (with the exception of the  Saturday after Thanksgiving). We will ask students who accept larger parts to come in for a few hours (if parents are willing to do ) in addition to the regularly scheduled hours; there will also be additional hours for costume fittings.
         </p>
         <br> 
         <p><b>What should I wear?</b> Wear comfortable clothing and shoes that you can
            move/dance/tumble in--no platform, no heels, --shoes for moving!!
         </p>
         <br> 
         <p><b>Will we have breaks?</b> Yes, we will begin the day with a break and will take
            a short break every hour. So, please have snack and water bottle AND
            ONLY WATER—no juice or sodas or sugary drinks Interns are in
            charge of monitoring students over the break periods--and encourage
            others to share food, take the opportunity to get water, go to the bathroom
            and/or run around outside on for a bit to stretch the legs and the soul.
            However please note that students must pick up after themselves.
         </p>
         <br> 
         <p><b>Should I bring food or drink?</b>  Yes, please plan on bringing a LIGHT
            snack--no candy please--and some water--NO SODA please. Bring healthy
            snacks that will give you energy--not a  sugar buzz! Feel free to bring a bit
            extra as a number of students end of sharing!!
         </p>
         <br> 
         <p><b>What role will I play?</b> Do I get to choose? The role you will end up playing
            involves a number of factors, first and foremost your willingness to be kind,
            supportive and a team player. Second, it involves your attitude and third,
            your experience and ability and finally, what role you are best suited to
            play. While we pride ourselves on being fair, we will not give a student a
            role unless it fits--think of it like a shoe, it must  be a comfortable fit--the
            right size. A student may get a part with lines or without lines, with dance
            numbers or without dance numbers--but everyone will be involved, and yes,
            everyone will sing--regardless of ability. The MOST IMPORTANT part is to
            make the very most of the role your do receive and to be caring and supportive of others.
         </p>
         <br> 
         <p><b>Is it a lot of work?</b> Yes, theatre involves both play and work--lots of work
            and a good deal of patience.  You must be willing to play hard and work
            hard and be prepared to wait patiently while others are on the
            stage.  Theatre is about waiting your turn, supporting others and being a
            respectful audience member. Bring a book, your homework, something to
            keep you occupied while you wait quietly!!
         </p>
         <br> 
         <p><b>Can I bring games or portable ds systems or iPad to play on during break or while I wait?</b> No, we ask for many reasons that you please leave all of these electronic devices at home, mp3 players, ds players, iPod, iPad, etcetera. We understand that many students will have smartphones in order to contact parents but again we ask that you not use them during the rehearsal period; we encourage you to socialize with others by
            playing and running around, sitting, and talking face to face, having a
            conversation, or sitting and reading or studying quietly. We continually
            encourage students to include everyone in their play...no one may be left out for any reason!!!
         </p>
         <br> 
         <p><b>When will I get a copy of the script?</b> Scripts are usually handed out
            during the first week of practice or early the second week, as we spend the
            early days getting to know one another better.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p><b>What’s the most important thing to know?</b> Our most important rule is:
            BE KIND TO OTHERS!!!!!!! No one is allowed to be unkind for any reason.
            Period. INCLUDE EVERYONE--no one should be left out, EVER!! Our Mantra with one another is very simple, a promise from each and all to acknowledge to one another verbally: “If you need me, I will be there.” 
         </p>
         <br> 
         <p><b>What if I’m not very good at acting or singing or dancing?</b>  No fear,
            when you arrive, you will be included no matter what...we’re here to learn what we need to know together and to have fun! Everything important comes down to remembering one thing: “Acting is Reacting!”
         </p>
         <br> 
         <p><b>How will I know what to do? </b> As I said: it’s about learning; these workshops are all about learning about theatre not proving what you already know. It’s about having fun and playing. Trust me, you’ll learn what you need to know...and when you don’t know, that’s okay to ask. There’s no such thing as a silly question. Whether it’s learning about blocking or lines, steps, or cues, or how to cheat out or finding your light—as well as the hot spot in your light, this is the place to learn through play. After all, they  call it putting on a PLAY for a reason! We learn best through play!
         </p>
         <br> 
         <p><b>When are the actual plays?</b> The play performances are the Friday evening
            and Saturday afternoon of the final week of the workshop (which in summer is 3 weeks long and in winter is 6 weeks long but with shorter hours each day).
         </p>
         <br> 
         <p><b>What kind of costumes will I wear?</b> We will supply your entire costume
            for the most part--although we will ask for you to bring a number of things
            from home, including white undershirt/t-shirt (to wear under costume),
            black stockings for the girls, black socks for the boys, black dress shoes
            (boots or dance/ballet slippers are also fine), hair ties, makeup: rouge,
            lipstick, base, eyeliner--everyone must wear makeup under the stage lights,
            males and females alike). There will be changing in front of peers and so
            we suggest that some kind of biking shorts are worn for the dress
            rehearsals and performances.
         </p>
         <br> 
         <p><b>When do I get to intern?</b> Interns are invited to work with us when they are
            entering HS or are in the 8th grade and may intern throughout high school.
            We encourage students to be involved and learn all aspects of theatre…if
            you’re interested or know someone who is, no experience necessary…we
            will train interns! We will invite some 7th graders to participate as junior
            interns—as an exception but normally regard anyone younger than 8th
            grade to be a tech student in training who must register as a student just
            like actors...as you are learning.
         </p>
         <br> 
         <p><b>What do the interns get to do?</b> Interns learn all aspects of stagecraft
            over time, including lights, sound, stage management, assistant stage
            management, assistant directing, front of house, coaching/assistance of
            actors.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p><b>What if I miss a day or longer?</b> Everyone must miss at various points for
            various reasons (sickness, other commitments). Do your best to be here
            when you are healthy, stay home when you’re not, but when you are not--
            no matter the reason, please give us a call or drop an email so we do not
            worry about you and your whereabouts. Many students participate in
            Orchestra or a dance class and we encourage students to attend
            these...except perhaps during our final week of practice...as those are very
            very important. Also, I will send out a full rehearsal schedule with any
            additions, etcetera in the first several weeks to note costume fittings
            etcetera. 
         </p>
         <br> 
         <p><b>What if I get sick for the actual play?</b> Of course, that has happened, but
            let’s focus on staying well…by eating healthy foods, getting plenty of sleep,
            washing your hands often throughout the day and drinking lots of water...and share food, but not drinks...and wash your hands after you go to the bathroom...and before you eat.
         </p>
         <br> 
         <p><b>I’m in High School and I want to be in the play as an actor?</b> Can I still
            be involved onstage and does it cost anything as a HS actor? Actors in
            high school and HS interns pay no tuition. Tuition is charged only for ES
            and MS students--whether tech or acting. That said, there are ALWAYS
            scholarships available for students who need a break or full tuition
            remission
         </p>
         <br> 
         <p><b>What are the THREE PLUS RULES OF ODYSSEY?</b> We have <b>THREE ESSENTIAL RULES</b> at Odyssey that we live and work and play by: 
            <b>1.) RESPECT SELF;</b><br><b>2.) RESPECT OTHERS;</b><br><b>1.) RESPECT SELF;</b><br><b>2.) RESPECT OTHERS;</b><br><b>1.) RESPECT SELF;</b><br><b>2.) RESPECT OTHERS;</b><br><b><b>3.) RESPECT THE SPACE.</b><br><b>PLUS,</b> have FUN!! Nothing else matters. If we work together and include everyone, the magic happens and the play will be a success!
